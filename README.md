# OperationStorm-RedBotSwarm
Allows RedBots to autonomously traverse a basketball court and arrange themselves in a predefined pattern such as a square.

Only the constants at the top of the program must be changed. 
The program works as follows: The bot navigates along the dark line of a basketball court. As the bot moves along, it detects white tick marks placed by the user. At a predefined number of ticks, the bot turns left or right and travels a predefined distance.

Using the square example, a bot enters from the bottom of the square. If destined for the upper left corner, it will detect 5 ticks, then turn left and go a distance of 2. If destined for the bottom right corner, it will detect 1 tick, then turn right and go a distance of 2.
